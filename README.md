PhysiCloud
==========

This repository houses the code for the PhysiCloud, a platform for programming and managing cyber-physical systems.

At this time, the software provides programming abstractions for resources, whether they are local to a system or located across the network. Developers can implement controllers in clojure and deploy within a PhysiCloud task.

Tutorials will be coming soon! For now, check out our test code for an example.
